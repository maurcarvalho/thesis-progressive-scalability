Cloud-native software startups face a fundamental architectural tension: microservices introduce premature operational complexity that overwhelms small teams, while traditional monoliths degrade into tightly coupled systems that progressively resist change. This research addresses the gap between these extremes by developing six actionable architectural guidelines (G1--G6) for progressive scalability in modular monolith applications.

A systematic literature review of 18 peer-reviewed studies published between 2019 and 2024 identified 12 evaluation criteria organized across four dimensions (Architectural Design, Operational Fit, Organizational Alignment, and Guideline Orientation) and revealed that no existing study directly addresses progressive scalability as a step-by-step guideline approach for modular monoliths. While the reviewed literature covers individual techniques in isolation, none integrate them into a cohesive, progressive guideline set. The core contribution of this research is precisely this integration: the G1$\rightarrow$G6 progression synthesizes individually studied techniques into a deliberate scalability pathway.

The six guidelines are: G1 (enforce modular boundaries through automated verification), G2 (embed maintainability as a bounded cost of change), G3 (design for progressive scalability across a four-level spectrum L0--L3), G4 (promote migration readiness using Apache Kafka and Temporal), G5 (streamline deployment strategy through a D0--D2 spectrum), and G6 (introduce observability patterns with OpenTelemetry). Together, they ensure that module extraction becomes a deployment topology change, not an architectural rewrite.

The guidelines are grounded in Tiny Store, a working reference implementation built as an Nx monorepo with four bounded contexts, 127 passing tests, and a production-grade infrastructure stack spanning 13 containerized services. Verification through semi-structured interviews with expert practitioners is planned as the next research phase.
