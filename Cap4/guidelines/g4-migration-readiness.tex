\section{G4: Migration Readiness}
\label{sec:g4-promote-migration-readiness}

In this section, we present G4, which emphasizes designing internal APIs, leveraging anti-corruption layers, and avoiding shared state to prepare for future migration. G4 ensures that modules can be extracted or replaced with minimal downstream impact.

  \item \emph{State management linter:} To be done.

  \item \emph{Migration readiness dashboard:} To be done.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Literature Support Commentary}
Most migration-oriented research treats modularity as an after-the-fact refactoring exercise, offering clustering algorithms or service identification tools but little on proactive design~\cite{deLauretis2019from, abgaz2023decomposition}. Anti-corruption layers and internal API versioning appear in microservices literature~\cite{fritzsch2019, jin2021}, yet their systematic application within monoliths is underexplored. G4 addresses this by turning migration readiness into a deliberate design objective rather than a reactive measure.
