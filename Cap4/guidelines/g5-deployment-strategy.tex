\section{G5: Deployment Strategy}
\label{sec:g5-align-deployment-strategy}

In this section, we present G5, which focuses on aligning deployment pipelines with module boundaries through partial builds, per-module configuration, and segmented observability. G5 ensures that even when the monolith is packaged as a single artifact, internal modularity informs CI/CD practices, deployment validation, and runtime monitoring.

\subsection*{Tool Capabilities}
Any open‐source or proprietary software tool used to support G5 should address:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=2pt]
  \item \emph{Partial build automation:} To be done.
  \item \emph{Module-specific config manager:} To be done.
  \item \emph{Observability segmentation tool:} To be done.
  \item \emph{CI/CD pipeline integration:} To be done.
  \item \emph{Deployment validation scripts:} To be done.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Literature Support Commentary}
While deployment strategies are extensively studied for microservices(e.g, CI/CD pipelines, blue-green deployments and containerization) few works tie these practices back to a modular monolith’s internal structure~\cite{montesi2021sliceable}. The assumption that monoliths deploy as indivisible units ignores embedded modular boundaries. G5 addresses this gap by proposing partial builds, module-specific configurations, and segmented observability as ways to operationalize monolith modularity in production.
